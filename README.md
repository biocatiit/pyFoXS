Determine small angle X-ray (SAXS) profiles.
The IMP.saxs module contains functions that, given an atomic protein structure,
can calculate its SAXS profile using the Debye formula, and then fit this
profile against the experimentally determined one. FoXS is a simple command
line interface to this functionality which takes as input a number of PDB
files and/or SAXS profiles. There is also a \salilab{foxs/,web server}
available.

_Examples_:
 - [Determination of a Nup133 structure](@ref foxs_nup133)
